What is Props Drilling:
  passing state/props values to multiple children compoenent

When to use useReducer:
  when a component has multiple state handling, go for useReducer with single initialState

context:
  when large state values is required for complete component tree ( entire application ) using Context.Provider


Redux:

  Large Applications uses Redux to Manage the 
    State, Actions, Data as a whole

  Example:
    Assume Gmail Application ( Doesn't Mean Gamil use Redux ) 
    uses a lot of components
      1. User ( mailid )
      2. Compose ( Subject, To, CC, BCC )
      3. Drafts ( Mail which is unfinished ) --> Drafts Count Increases
      4. Categories, Junk, Starred, Important, Chats.

    Above entities/features of application uses different types of Desgin, Interactions, States

    This case managing the state/data only with basic state on inidividual components and passing the data to the required components is very difficult

    May lead to props drilling or more num of callbacks

  Concept to Understand Redux:
    Think a Online Order scenario,

      what are all the end-to-end steps in an online order
  
  useReducer ( Redux like hook which help understanding redux )

  Redux:
    External libraries for state management using different reducers

    Install the package with ---> npm install @reduxjs/toolkit
    react-redux
    Chrome-Extension - redux-devtools

    1. Store Setup with initial State and reducers - Done
      manipulation of the store 
    2. Actions ()
    3. Reducers ()
